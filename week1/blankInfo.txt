Week 1 - Git/GitHub

Objective:
- Learn basic Git commands
- Understand the working tree
- Creating branches and resolving merge conflicts

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction: This repository serves as a skeleton repository where you 
can find blank homework assignments, which will be updated weekly. (This 
workflow will be similar to how CS 61B handles assignments.)

To begin, you will fork this repository into your personal GitHub account 
and work on assignments from there. Each week, you should pull the latest 
updates from the main repository to stay up to date with the homework.

For submissions, please create a pull request from your fork to the main 
repository (PD-Assigments). This will allow us to review and grade your work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Homework Instructions:
- Set up Git:
	- Fork the main repository (PD-Assignments) to create a copy in 
	  your own GitHub account (Click on the "Fork" button on the 
	  top-right corner of the page).
	- Open Terminal
	- Create a Folder for Open Project PD:
		- EX:
		$ cd
		$ cd Desktop
		$ mkdir OP-PD
		$ cd OP-PD
		- Check your path:
		$ pwd
		/Users/your_username/Desktop/OP-PD
	- Clone the repository using: 
		$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/PD-Assigments.git
	- Change directory to PD-Assignments:
		$ cd PD-Assignments
	- Set Upstream Remote:
		$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/MAIN_REPO_OWNER/PD-Assigments.git 
	- This would allow you to pull changes and new assignments from 
	  the PD repository and push changes to your own personal repository
	- Since we already set up the repository, you do not need to 
	  run "git init", but if you are creating a new project or directory, 
	  you would initialize the Git repository with "git init"
	- To switch to main branch & pull assignments:
		- Switch branches: git switch branch-name
			- OR: git checkout branch-name
		- Switch to new branches: git switch -C branch-name
			- OR: git checkout -b branch-name
		- Switch to main:
		$ git switch main
		$ git pull upstream main
	- Create a new branch for each this week's homework with format: firstname-week01
		- Ex: jenny-week01
		- Try creating the branch yourself! using the instruction 
		  about switch branches above.
	- Now you are swiched to the branch for week 01! Congrats!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Files:
	- Following the instructons above, you should have created your 
	  personal repository and pull the assignment folder for week 1 
	  including this file.
	- Now here are some common commands for files:
		- Display path: $ pwd
		- Change directory: $ cd <directory-name>
		- Create new directory: $ mkdir <directory-name>
		- List files in a directory: $ ls
		- Create a new file: $ touch <file-name>
		- View contents of a file: $ cat <file-name>
		- Copy a File: $ cp <source-file> <destination-file>
		- Move a File: $ mv <source-file> <destination-directory>
			- Ex: $ mv myfile.txt /home/user/documents/
		- Rename a file: $ mv <old-file-name> <new-file-name>
		- Delete a file: $ rm <file -name>
	- Feel free to play around with all the commands in your week 1 branch!
